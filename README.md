# `reference`

This is where formal proposals regarding the Toaq language should be submitted (through the issue tracker). Of importance is the `reference.md` document, which records all points which have been established through discussion. Currently, the structure of this document imitates that of the official Toaq description (solpahi 2017), but you are free to add subsections if you think they are needed.
